In this article, we are going to design and build a portfolio website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A portfolio website is a website that represents you online on the web pages. It contains different sections like Introduction to Yourself, About You, Your Services, Your Contact Details, and Your Portfolio. We are going to build all of the sections with an interactive and attractive web design that attracts more visitors using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
In the first step, we will create a folder with the project name and create the HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, Images folder and a separate file for the responsive CSS if required.
Now, use the different HTML tags like section, header, nav, meta, title, head, div, input, img etc to structure the web page.
Style the different components and the elements of HTML responsively to make the page attractive for every device using CSS.
Make use of the media queries to define the responsive styles and to adjust the width of the containers.
Use JavaScript to toggle the on click to the hamburger menu for small width devices to navigate through the page.
